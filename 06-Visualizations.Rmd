# Discussion {#discussion}

This is where we will write things, ahaha

## Other fun things 

Features that we were interested in, but didn't get a chance to follow through on or did not align with the primary goal of the project. :)

### Interactive Chloropleths

```{r}
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tmap)
```

```{r}
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)
```

```{r}
avgDM <- distinct(debtMedian)

plot_geo() %>%
  add_trace(
    z = ~avgDM$avgDebt,
    span = I(0),
    colorscale = 'viridis',
    locations = avgDM$state, 
    locationmode = 'USA-states'
  ) %>%
  colorbar(title = NULL) %>%
  layout(geo = g, title = "Avg. Faculty Salary by State (in USD)")
```

### Gender 

```{r}

#Universities with the highest female/male ratio, the top 10 are mostly R2's for both categories

cdem %>%
  arrange(desc(female)) %>%
  filter(female > .50) %>%
  distinct(university, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)

cdem %>%
  arrange(female) %>%
  filter(female < .50) %>%
  distinct(university, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)

R1s <- cdem %>%
  filter(r_status == "R1")

ggplot(cdem, aes(x = female)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, color = "black", fill = "pink") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Female/Male Gender ratio at R1s")

R2s <- cdem %>%
  filter(r_status == "R2")

ggplot(R2s, aes(x = female)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, color = "black", fill = "skyblue") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Female/Male Gender ratio at R2s")

```
